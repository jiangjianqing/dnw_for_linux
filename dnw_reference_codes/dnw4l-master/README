1. DESCRIPTION
--------------
This is DNW For Linux (dnw4l) application.

dnw4l allows uploading binary images over USB to Samsung SoCs-based boards
with USB/DNW support.


2. PACKAGE CONTENTS
-------------------
dnw4l.c			- source code
dnw4l.h
Makefile

board.conf		- board configuration file (example)
11-dnw4l.rules		- udev rule (example)
README			- this file


3. REQUIRED LIBRARIES
---------------------
libusb-1.0


4. HOW TO BUILD IT
------------------
* Install libusb-1.0 library and its devel package.
* Build the application:

for x86:

	$ make clean
	$ make

for x86-64:

	$ make clean
	$ ENV=-m64 make


5. HOW TO USE IT
----------------

5.1. Board configuration file

Board configuration file contains information that is necessary
to find your board among other USB devices connected to your PC.
Before you start using this application you should add your board
related information to configuration file. Use board.conf as an
example.

Use dmesg, usbfs or sysfs to get your board info.

5.2. Uploading images

1) Turn on the target board and activate USB/DNW mode.

2) Upload an image using dnw4l.

as root:

	# ./dnw4l [-b board_name] [-c config_file] image

dnw4l uses board_name to find your board related information in
configuration file config_file.

Example 1:

	# ./dnw4l -b MINI2440 -c /home/user/work/board.conf ./uImage

Example 2:

	# ./dnw4l -b MINI2440 ./uImage

	dnw4l looks for default configuration file (board.conf) in current
	working directory.

Example 3:

	# ./dnw4l ./zImage

	dnw4l uses default board info that is suitable for Samsung
	SMDK boards. (see also: 7. KNOWN PROBLEMS)

Default board info:

	ram_base = 0x40008000
	idVendor = 0x04e8
	idProduct = 0x1234;

To get usage help run:

	$ ./dnw4l -h

Note: To be able to run dnw4l as user, create appropriate udev rule.
      Use 11-dnw4l.rules file as an example.

6. KNOWN PROBLEMS
-----------------
U-boot USB device driver for Samsung SMDK boards uses the same
values for the fields in Device Descriptor. This makes impossible
to distinguish such boards automatically. Use -b option to select
specific board or use default board info.
